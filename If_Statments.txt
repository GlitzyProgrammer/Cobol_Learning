General Structure 

IF {thing true} THEN 
  {code if  thing is true}
END-IF {}

Condtional Types 

Relation 
	Like the usual = < > >= <= but no not but there is NOT

When comparing values the values must be the same type  no string to numeric such and such


You can do the conditional on Classes like numeric or alphabetic not in the Object Oriented sense  


Setting things to TRUE
  Follows this convention SET ConditionName TO TRUE 
  useful for testing in my opinoin but for now I'll wont focus on this specifically
